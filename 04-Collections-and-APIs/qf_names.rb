# List processing
#
# Write a method which accepts an array of names as an argument and
# returns a list of names and their associated lengths.

# Write a second method which accepts array returned by first one
# and prints out each name and its length. If the name is longer than 6
# characters the method needs to print out "Wow, that's a long name!"
